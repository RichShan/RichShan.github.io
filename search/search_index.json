The goal of the project was to allow the user to record all inputs into a computer, including things such as mouse movements, dragging, mouse clicks, key presses, scrolling, and delays. Those actions should then be stored or logged. The actions can then be replayed exactly as they were recorded.","title":"Macro"},{"location":"coding/macro/#macro-maker","text":"The Macro project was my final project for Java Data Structures.

The kit consisted of a bunch of small plastic parts which would be assembled together to create a small arcade machine. The acrylic was cut pretty roughly, however, so picking the pieces apart took some time. The largest problem, by far, was that the build had structural integrity issues through much of the assembly process due to only being held together by a single screw and would fall apart whenever it was turned. I solved this problem through having someone else assist me in holding the arcade as I pushed the pieces together. After all the pieces were in, the arcade was a lot more stable. I first added the joystick and input buttons onto the board. I then attached the speaker. Here are all the acrylic pieces laid out before assembly: Next, I assembled the first side of the arcade, along with attaching the battery and the screw. I then put the second side of the arcade machine in, allowing me to fully screw both sides together. This is what the arcade looks like after assembling the rest of the acrylic pieces: Final step: stickers!","title":"Arcade"},{"location":"fab/arcade/#tiny-arcade","text":"Today, I fully built and assembled the Tiny Arcade kit.
