The kit consisted of a bunch of small plastic parts which would be assembled together to create a small arcade machine. The acrylic was cut pretty roughly, however, so picking the pieces apart took some time. The largest problem, by far, was that the build had structural integrity issues through much of the assembly process due to only being held together by a single screw and would fall apart whenever it was turned. I solved this problem through having someone else assist me in holding the arcade as I pushed the pieces together. After all the pieces were in, the arcade was a lot more stable. I first added the joystick and input buttons onto the board. I then attached the speaker. Here are all the acrylic pieces laid out before assembly: Next, I assembled the first side of the arcade, along with attaching the battery and the screw. I then put the second side of the arcade machine in, allowing me to fully screw both sides together. This is what the arcade looks like after assembling the rest of the acrylic pieces: Final step: stickers! Adding Games The base arcade came loaded with only 3 games on it. However, the arcade is able to support other games through a micro SD card. The instructions for doing so can be found on the TinyCircuits website here . My regular computer didn't have either an SD card or microSD port so I had to switch to a second computer. After that, I downloaded the other games from the TinyCircuits website . This is what the zip file containing all the games looks like. Within each of these game folders is a bin and a tsv file for that respective game. I then uploaded the contents of the zip file into the micro SD card, which was the D drive under my file system. After ejecting the micro SD card from the computer port, I put it into the port inside the TinyArcade machine. Instead of displaying a screen upon startup with a message notifying the user that there is no SD card inserted, the Arcade now starts up and allows the user to play all the imported games. The Arcade steps through the games in alphabetical order. All the added games are now playable!","title":"Tiny Arcade"},{"location":"fab/arcade/#tiny-arcade","text":"","title":"Tiny Arcade"},{"location":"fab/arcade/#assembly","text":"Today, I fully built and assembled the Tiny Arcade kit.

We were each given a bit of wood which we cut into the body of the pen. We then assembled the parts together. This was also my first time turning a pen so there were a few mishaps but overall, my final product turned out well! With the help of my instructor, I first cut the wood into rectangular prisms. Next, I then used the lathe to drill a cylindrical hole inside the wood. I then sanded the copper tubes which would hold the pen cartridge in order to rough them up a bit to give it more surface area when gluing. I then glued the tubes into the previously drilled hole inside the wood. I then put the wood blocks on the lathe, pushing the rod through the copper tubes glued inside the wood. Then I used different tipped tools to chip away parts of the wood, first chipping away large chunks and eventually using a finer tipped tool to make small modifications. After cutting the wood down to a thin cylindrical shape, I used sandpaper to smooth out the surface, starting with very rough sandpaper to remove some material and flatten the surface then using finer and finer grade sandpaper to create a very smooth surface. After sanding the wood into a smooth surface, I applied a light spray of glue and accelerant as a final coating. I then used the crusher to push the pen tip, clip, and cap together with the wood body and copper cores. Here is what the pen looks like after finishing assembly:","title":"Pen Turning"},{"location":"fab/pen/#pen-turning","text":"For my first woodworking project during Fab, I turned a pen from a kit containing 2 copper tubes, an ink cartridge, and a pen tip and cap.

This helping hand was a lot better than the ones I had used before as it had 4 different clips that could hold an item in almost any direction. Here are all the materials: I first took all the materials out of the packaging. I then attached the alligator clips onto the legs. I put in the first two shorter legs into the base and screwed them in. After attaching the final two longer legs onto the base of the stand, the helping hand was complete. Spinner Assembly After assembling the soldering stand, I started soldering together the spinner. I built a three leaf gyroscope spinner (fidget spinner) with LEDs. The spinner uses a ball bearing to spin around the center and is able to change the patterns on the LEDs. The kit came with all the components (except the batteries) and was used as practice for surface-mount soldering. Here is the frame before any assembly: First, I soldered one of the sides on each 100 ohm resistor to align them all. After everything was aligned, I soldered on the other side of the resistors. I then soldered on the LEDs and the MCU chip. Next, I soldered on the button. I then soldered on the capacitor. Next, I soldered on the battery holders and put the batteries in it. The actual board of the spinner is now complete. Here is the spinner when I was testing the LEDs to make sure they worked before putting the framing on: After I verified that the components were working, I the ball bearing in and encased it all in the plastic frame. Here is the completed spinner as with LEDs on as it spins. The LEDs are able to light up in different sequences to form different patterns when spinning, but the camera on my phone was unable to capture the patterns becuase it wasn't very receptive to fast moving objects.","title":"Three Leaf Gyroscope Spinner"},{"location":"fab/spinner/#three-leaf-gyroscope-spinner","text":"","title":"Three Leaf Gyroscope Spinner"},{"location":"fab/spinner/#helping-hand-assembly","text":"Because this was my first time soldering after starting the Fab program, I had to build a helping hand for me to keep and use at home before I started building the three leaf gyroscope spinner.
