The final product allows the user to start and end a global recording of all inputs to the computer. The global recording will inputs including mouse movements; mouse dragging; mouse clicking, releasing, and holding; key presses, releases, and hold times; and any simultaneous combination of events. The actions are also logged in the logger.out file. After the user begins recording, (CTRL + SHIFT+ R), all henceforth input actions are recorded until the user stops recording (CTRL + SHIFT + S). Upon replaying, the program will execute the actions exactly as recorded. The press() methods also delays the action's execution as to match the delays between actions of the original recording. The program does not interfere with input actions or other applications in any way. Inspiration I've done a lot of scripting before, both static and dynamic through OCR. My goal with this project was to make a program that could record your actions and replay them with no need for hard coding or manual key press/mouse coordinate tracking. In the future, I plan to make make the project's logging function more useful, where the logging of actions into a seperate .txt document can function as a saved user macro sequence. Eventually I want to add a feature where the program is able to ingest a log file and replay the actions stored there, allowing users to save a specific macro multiple times past the closure of the JFrame. Method The main library that enabled the creation of this project is JNativeHook , which allows the global tracking of all actions that are sent into a computer, as opposed to only being able to detect inputs inside a specific window. In this project, JNativeHook's GlobalScreen and adapters were used, but I have overriden the action listeners and adapters with my own code to suit the needs of this project, specifically storage and replaying of inputs. When the program is running and recording is true (the user has started recording), every input action triggers a specific handler method which is able to encapsulate the event as an object to store in the recordedActions stack. During recording, a global variable of time is used to keep track of delays between actions. Every time a new action is recorded, the variable is then updated to the time in milliseconds when the action was performed. When the next action is then recorded, subtracting the last recorded time from the current system time gives us the delay, which is stored as part of the action object. Then, the time variable is updated. Thus, we are able to track the delays between actions in order to replay them at the right times. The different action classes (ClickPress, ClickRelease, KeyPress, KeyRelease, MouseMove) allow the program to store every input as an individual object. All these classes implement the Action interface, giving them all a press() method which is called when replaying. Here is an example of the handler method creating a new object: @Override public void nativeKeyPressed(NativeKeyEvent e) { // This method is called when a key is pressed; other methods handle other events. recordedActions.add(new KeyPress(e, Math.abs(System.currentTimeMillis()-time))); // Creates a new KeyPress object in the stack, parsing in the NativeKeyEvent generated by JNativeHook/GlobalScreen and the time since last recorded action time = System.currentTimeMillis(); // Updates variable time } // For context, the constructor for KeyPress is: public KeyPress(NativeKeyEvent ke, long delay) {...} The other adapter and conversion classes (SwingKeyAdapter, MouseCoordinateConverter, KeyLocationLookup, KeyCursorLookup) allow for conversion between different keycodes and screen sizes. The SwingKeyAdapter, KeyLocationLookup, and KeyCursorLookup classes convert VC keycodes used by NativeKeyEvent into VK keycodes used by KeyEvent. The MouseCoordinateConverter class allows for conversion between physical mouse cursor coordinate positions and scaled mouse cursor coordinate positions, allowing MouseMove to move the cursor to the correct point for all screen sizes on different computers. For example, the KeyPress class uses SwingKeyAdapter to translate a NativeKeyEvent keycode integer value to a KeyEvent keycode, which is what the robot from java.awt.Robot can interpret and use. @Override public void press() { robot.delay((int) delay); // Waits the millisecond amount as parsed from the constructor robot.keyPress(ska.getJavaKeyEvent(e).getKeyCode()); // Uses SwingKeyAdapter to convert keycode values } During recording, all input actions are created as new objects of their respective class and are stored in a stack until the user stops. Upon replaying the stored actions, the program will iterate through the stack and call each object's press() method to execute the action exactly as performed. for(Action i : recordedActions) { i.press(); /* The implementation of the Action inferface by all the input action classes allows me to call a generic .press() function */ } For more information, the full project can be found open-sourced on the Github repo and the downloadable jar file is not obfuscated and is decompilable.

The kit consisted of a bunch of small plastic parts which would be assembled together to create a small arcade machine. The acrylic was cut pretty roughly, however, so picking the pieces apart took some time. The largest problem, by far, was that the build had structural integrity issues through much of the assembly process due to only being held together by a single screw and would fall apart whenever it was turned. I solved this problem through having someone else assist me in holding the arcade as I pushed the pieces together. After all the pieces were in, the arcade was a lot more stable. Materials The kit that we assembled can be found on the manufacturer's website here . The kit included: 32-bit ARM processor OLED screen MicroSD card compatibility for game and video storage Joystick with two working pushbuttons Built-in speaker with volume control Rechargeable lithium battery USB port for charging and loading Acrylic casing Decorative stickers 5-pin Wireling connector for adding different dimensions to games Assembly I assembled the tiny arcade following the instructions within the manual provided in the kit. There were no major complications other than having some issues tearing off the wrapping for the acrylic due to having short nails and some difficulty in pushing the acrylic pieces together. I first added the joystick and input buttons onto the board. I then attached the speaker. I tore off the wrapping paper from all the acrylic walling. Here are all the acrylic pieces laid out before assembly: Next, I assembled the first side of the arcade, along with attaching the battery and the screw. I then put the second side of the arcade machine in, allowing me to fully screw both sides together. This is what the arcade looks like after assembling the rest of the acrylic pieces: Final step: stickers! Adding Games The base arcade came loaded with only 3 games on it. However, the arcade is able to support other games through a micro SD card. The instructions for doing so can be found on the TinyCircuits website here . My regular computer didn't have either an SD card or microSD port so I had to switch to a second computer. After that, I downloaded the other games from the TinyCircuits website . This is what the zip file containing all the games looks like. Within each of these game folders is a bin and a tsv file for that respective game. I then uploaded the contents of the zip file into the micro SD card, which was the D drive under my file system. After ejecting the micro SD card from the computer port, I put it into the port inside the TinyArcade machine.

We were each given a bit of wood which we cut into the body of the pen. We then assembled the parts together. This was also my first time turning a pen so there were a few mishaps but overall, my final product turned out well! With the help of my instructor, I first cut the wood into rectangular prisms. Next, I then used the lathe to drill a cylindrical hole inside the wood. I then sanded the copper tubes which would hold the pen cartridge in order to rough them up a bit to give it more surface area when gluing. I then glued the tubes into the previously drilled hole inside the wood. I then put the wood blocks on the lathe, pushing the rod through the copper tubes glued inside the wood. Then I used different tipped tools to chip away parts of the wood, first chipping away large chunks and eventually using a finer tipped tool to make small modifications. After cutting the wood down to a thin cylindrical shape, I used sandpaper to smooth out the surface, starting with very rough sandpaper to remove some material and flatten the surface then using finer and finer grade sandpaper to create a very smooth surface. After sanding the wood into a smooth surface, I applied a light spray of glue and accelerant as a final coating. I then used the crusher to push the pen tip, clip, and cap together with the wood body and copper cores. Here is what the pen looks like after finishing assembly: Pen Rotary Engraving We used the rotary machine to engrave a cylindrical object inside the laser cutter. This was my first time using the rotary machine (along with my classmates and my instructor), so we spent a lot of time reading the manufacturer's instructions and figuring out the software. I first cut a cylinder of wood to use as a test for the rotary machine and to figure out how it works. I then put the wood cylinder into the rotary machine inside of the laser cutter and did a trial print. After successfully completing the test run, I then put my pen into the rotary machine and ran an engraving on it. However, I didn't realize that when importing the file to print, part of the text that was supposed to be engraved was actually off the page. Because I didn't realize this until after taking the pen out of the laser cutter and seeing the botched print, I was stuck with a pen that was emblazoned with \"ichard Shan\", but as I didn't want to be stuck with an ugly pen I decided to use an exacto-knife to manually engrave the \"R\" at the start.","title":"Pen Turning"},{"location":"fab/pen/#pen-turning","text":"For my first woodworking project during Fab, I turned a pen from a kit containing 2 copper tubes, an ink cartridge, and a pen tip and cap.
