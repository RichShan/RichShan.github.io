The goal of the project was to allow the user to record all inputs into a computer, including things such as mouse movements, dragging, mouse clicks, key presses, scrolling, and delays. Those actions should then be stored or logged. The actions can then be replayed exactly as they were recorded.","title":"Macro"},{"location":"coding/macro/#macro-maker","text":"The Macro project was my final project for Java Data Structures.

The kit consisted of a bunch of small plastic parts which would be assembled together to create a small arcade machine. The hardest part was pushing the plastic pieces together as the acrylic was pretty roughly cut. I solved this through constant tinkering and trying different angles. The build had bad structural integrity due to only being held together by a single screw and would fall apart during the assembly process. After all the pieces had been put in place, the arcade machine was stable and would stand on its own. I first added the joystick onto the board. I then attached the speaker. Here are all the acrylic pieces before assembly:","title":"Arcade"},{"location":"fab/arcade/#tiny-arcade","text":"Today, I fully built and assembled the Tiny Arcade kit.
