<p>The purpose of this unit was to familiarize ourselves to the entire milling process. We discussed different types of milling machines, and their respective differences and use cases. We first created and milled a simple design on a dog tag to get used to the milling process. Then, we designed a model for a chocolate mold and milled it on a block of wax. Finally, we laser cut a box from cardstock to fit the Valentine's Day theme.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply double-sided adhesive to your material and the bed. Position and place the material on the bed.</li>
<li>Open Bantam Tools Software</li>
<li>Under home, select install tool, and select the bit that you are installing</li>
<li>Insert your tool into the spindle<ul>
<li>Use the 2 wrenches by the milling machine and align them respectively to the top of the spindle area and by the middle bit area where their imprints are</li>
<li>Have you or a partner hold the bit itself while you unscrew it. This is to prevent the bit from dropping onto the bed and potentially breaking.</li>
<li>To loosen the bit, bring the 2 wrenches in towards each other</li>
<li><strong>If using multiple bits, select them all under File Setup. Start with the smallest tool and make your way to the largest.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probe<ul>
<li>Move the metal prong from the side of the bed to sit on top of it. Make sure that they touch so electricity can conduct.</li>
<li>Click <code>Z Only Stick Probing</code> and use the Jog menu to move the spindle above your material. </li>
<li>Once the spindle is positioned above your material, start the probing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under Material Setup, leave the <code>Material Offset Z</code> at 0.01mm</li>
<li>Change the <code>Material Size</code> to the dimensions of your material.</li>
<li>Import your file under File Setup</li>
<li>Choose the bit(s) you will be using</li>
<li>You can see the projection of the result on the right side of the screen. Use the <code>Plan Offset</code> x, y, and z setting to move the placement of the design around.</li>
<li>Ensure that you have the correct bit selected and inserted into the machine.</li>
<li>Run the job from the Summary/Run section. It is recommended to run the engraving job before the cutting job to ensure that your material does not move around.</li>
<li>If you are using multiple bits, the machine will pause during the job and prompt you to change bits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dog-tag">Dog Tag</h2>
<p>Before milling the dog tag, I brainstormed an idea for what the tag would look like. I decided upon a simple design with just my name on the tag.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../../pics/milling/dogtagSketch.jpg" alt="Dog tag sketch" height="300" width="500"/>
</center></p>
<p>I then created the design in CorelDraw. To do this, I first imported a template of the dogtag. This template functions as effective boundaries for my design to ensure that they can all be milled inside the actual dogtag. I then created a textbox inside the area of the dogtag and type my name into it. The following image image contains both the outline and the text, but when actually milling the file, I deleted the outline and only milled the text, as the outline is just a reference to guage size and there is no need to cut out the outline of the dog tag because it is already an individual material piece.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../../pics/milling/dogtagCorel.jpg" alt="Dog tag corel" height="200" width="250"/>
</center></p>
<p>I then sent the file to Bantam Software and milled it on the Bantam Desktop CNC Machine. I first set the dimensions of the material to the size of the dogtag, measured via calipers. Next, I equipped the 1/8" bit and used Bantam Software's <code>Install Tool</code> function to ensure that the tool was homed and its length was calibrated correctly. I then used the <code>Z Only Stick Probing</code> function to calibrate the height offset of my material. I then ran the job.</p>
<p><center></p>
<video muted width="500" height="300" controls><source src="../../pics/milling/dogtagTimeLapse.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>
<p></center></p>
<p>The main problem I encountered was the machine not milling deep enough to actually engrave the material, as the bit would either only barely touch the dog tag or start engraving in the air altogether. This problem was solved by rebooting both the machine and the software and redoing the tool length calibration and Z Material Offset calibration. Here is the final milled dogtag:</p>
