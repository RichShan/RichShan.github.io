<h1 id="smathhacks2025">SMathHacks2025</h1>
<p>This page includes documentation for ARES-M: Atmospheric Remote Environmental System for Mars, submitted for the Hardware track at the  SMathHacks 2025 hackathon. Our team members include <a href="mailto:richardmshan@gmail.com"><strong>Richard Shan</strong></a>, <a href="mailto:sah26a@ncssm.edu"><strong>Aaditya Sah</strong></a>, <a href="mailto:bedson26t@ncssm.edu"><strong>Trevor Bedson</strong></a>, and <a href="mailto:chilukuri26j@ncssm.edu"><strong>Josh Chilukuri</strong></a>. ARES is a remote autonomous sensor suite for Mars, monitoring temperature, humidity, seismic activity, UV/IR, and soil moisture in real time to advance planetary science and environmental research. <a href="https://smathhacks-2025.devpost.com/"><strong>SMathHacks 2025</strong></a> was hosted 2/8/2025 to 2/9/2025.</p>

<p>ARES is an integrated hardware-software solution featuring a remote sensor suite to detect temperature, humidity, seismic activity, and soil moisture monitoring on Mars. The nature of ARES' scalable mesh network deployment enables real-time environmental data acquisition across a distributed sensor array on multiple varied geographic locations simultaneously. A geospatially interactive interface allows users to access and analyze live telemetry along with a visualization of recently recorded data.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>The idea for ARES emerged from the need for a more efficient and scalable approach to environmental monitoring on Mars. Existing planetary weather stations such as NASA’s InSight lander and Curiosity’s REMS provide valuable atmospheric and seismic data but are limited in coverage and flexibility. InSight, for example, offers stationary readings from a single location, while Curiosity’s sensors can only gather data wherever the rover happens to be. These limitations pose challenges for understanding global weather patterns, seismic activity, and potential water presence on Mars. Given the planet’s extreme conditions—dust storms, drastic temperature shifts, and geological activity—there is a critical need for a distributed, autonomous sensor system capable of continuous real-time data collection across multiple locations.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../../smathhacks/pics/insightLander.jpg" alt="Insight Lander" width="550"/>
</center></p>
<p>ARES was designed to address these challenges through a scalable mesh network of remote sensor pods that can be deployed across varied Martian terrain. These pods continuously monitor temperature, humidity, seismic activity, and soil moisture, providing high-resolution environmental data to researchers. AI integration allows for real-time processing, adaptive calibration, and anomaly detection, enhancing data accuracy and reliability in Mars’ harsh conditions. The system is paired with a geospatial visualization platform, enabling users to interact with a live map of Mars, click on sensor locations, and access real-time environmental data streams. Inspired by terrestrial meteorological and seismic networks, ARES brings a planetary-scale sensing solution to Mars, laying the groundwork for future habitat planning, climate research, and exploration missions.</p>
<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
<p>Our initial vision for ARES was centered on creating a comprehensive atmospheric and environmental monitoring system, with a strong focus on air quality analysis. Originally, we planned to incorporate sensors for volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) to better understand Mars’ atmospheric composition and potential hazards. These sensors would have allowed us to analyze dust composition, detect trace gases, and assess air quality, providing insights into both habitability and long-term climate trends on the planet. However, we faced a lot of logistical challenges considering our timeframe was only 2 days long. Our ordered sensors did not arrive in time, and forced us to adapt our approach while maintaining the core functionality of the system.</p>
<p>To ensure that ARES remained a robust and scientifically valuable solution, we pivoted to include sunlight sensors (UV/IR) and seismic monitoring instead. This adjustment allowed us to capture even more important environmental data despite our sensors not being shipped properly. Specifically, ultraviolet and infrared radiation monitoring is particularly relevant for Martian exploration since it helps assess surface conditions, radiation exposure risks for future missions, and potential atmospheric dust interactions. The shift also streamlined our hardware integration as it allowed us to develop and assemble the entire device without having any uncertainty about parts. While our final implementation has slightly different measurements than my original plan, our central idea remains the same and our changes have only reinforced the robustness of ARES.</p>
<h2 id="cad">CAD</h2>
<p>Since we developed the entire device in only two days, we created a simple yet highly effective and theme-matching CAD model. We created a hexagonal case for our electronics, with spots on the top for the sunlight and temperature/humidity sensor, as those needed access to light or the air respectively. We created an opening on the bottom of the hexagonal case for the soil moisture sensor to be deployed from. Spikes were added on the bottom as a way for the device to mount into extraterrestrial soil when dropped from a decent height, and serves to secure the device in place. We notate the ARES name and Pod number on the top of each individual pod.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/aresHomeView.jpg" alt="Ares Home View" width="450"/>
</center></p>
<p>Internally, we designed mounts for the temperature/humidity sensor, sunlight sensor, and the MPU6050. The temperature/humidity sensor mount is shown on the left side of this image, and has a mesh on top of it so that the sensor is not completely exposed to the elements whilst also being able to access air for measuring humidity and temperature. The sunlight sensor mount is on the right side of this internal image, and faces directly upward into the sky to access the light. In production, we put a section of clear tape over the hole so that the sensor is protected while also being able to access its necessary measurements. The accelerometer and gyroscope sensor is mounted to the print directly, and is aided in contact area by the mount located in the upper right extrusion in this image. The servo is mounted in production directly to the print.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/aresInternal.jpg" alt="Ares Internal View" width="450"/>
</center></p>
<p>The locations for the temperature/humidity sensor and sunlight sensor are clearly visible in the top view of the design. The mesh underneath the Pod 1 label houses the temperature/humidity sensor. The small cutout above the ARES insignia is where the sunlight sensor is mounted, and protected by a tape-over.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/aresTopView.jpg" alt="Ares Top View" width="450"/>
</center></p>
<p>Finally, we added spikes on the bottom to act as stakes to secure the ARES Pod to the ground, and protect it in dangerous Martian conditions such as storms and earthquakes. It is important  that ARES is able to survive these events and continue transmitting data, as gathering data about these abnormalities is a key application of ARES.</p>

<h2 id="electrical-engineering">Electrical Engineering</h2>
<p>Before beginning any electrical engineering, we first researched the pinouts of all the sensors that we were to use. We then assembled the entire circuit in a basic schematic to plan out everything. Unfortunately, during these two days we were unable to access a desktop CNC machine to mill a PCB, so we never ended up creating a board design and instead simply referred to the schematic during design and soldering.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/wiringSchematic.jpg" alt="Schematic" width="750"/>
</center></p>
<p>Before we assembled the finalized soldered circuit, we first tested using a test ESP32 Feather V2 board on a breadboard circuit. We used the same wiring that would be our final design, excluding the servo that was added in a later iteration.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/featherBreadboard.jpg" alt="Breadboard circuit" width="450"/>
</center></p>
<p>As the ESP32 Feather V2 board was NCSSM property, we switched over to a spare Xiao Seeed ESP32S3 chip that Richard had. We chose the ESP32 architecture due to its native Wi-Fi capabilities, as we knew we would send data over a wireless network to the frontend. This involved minor changes in our code. Here is what our final circuit looks like when it is integrated into the system.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="../pics/integratedCircuit.jpg" alt="Final Circuit Integrated" width="600"/>
</center></p>
<p>We used the following sensors: MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, SI1145 sunlight sensor, DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, and a capacitive soil moisture sensor.</p>
<h2 id="backend-software">Backend Software</h2>
<p>Our following ESP32-based embedded system script establishes a Wi-Fi connection to facilitate remote environmental and motion data acquisition, processing, and transmission. It integrates multiple sensor modalities, including an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU) for three-axis acceleration and angular velocity, a DHT11 for temperature and humidity sensing, an SI1145 for ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) irradiance measurement, and a capacitive soil moisture sensor for substrate hydration assessment. A servo motor is utilized for lowering the soil moisture sensor into the ground for more accurate readings.</p>
<p>The system utilizes I2C communication protocol to acquire real-time sensor readings, which are encapsulated within a structured JSON object via the ArduinoJson library. This JSON payload is transmitted via an HTTP POST request to a remote server hosting the frontend API endpoint and is secured through authentication tokens. The pod transmits data through the mesh network to the endpoint every 5 seconds to ensure live-time data measurements. The system concurrently logs network status and signal strength to the serial interface for diagnostic purposes, since we experienced many issues with Wi-Fi during development.</p>

<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>The front end was developed using a Next.js framework powered by React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Post CSS. A Postgresql database was deployed using Docker to collect real-time live data from the sensor. To interact with the data, we used Prisma ORM and created our API for the embedded system to send information. We used the Chart.js library to create data visualizations. </p>
<p>Postgresql was chosen due to its proficiency in collecting time series and station data structures, which are highly compatible with the relational database and table. Postgresql’s rapid and efficient data storage also allowed us to answer API requests effectively. We deployed our application using docker-compose to securely isolate the database while maintaining client-server interaction. Our front and back end were deployed on a local server, making docker the ideal selection to optimize build speed.. </p>
<p>We structured our database to have a table for each station, and specific weather data payloads. This decision allowed us to quickly select databases and find associated weather data  by utilizing prisma’s include parameter when querying.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">model Station {
 id   String @unique
 name String


 weatherData WeatherData[]
}


model WeatherData {
 id Int @unique @default(autoincrement())


 latitude  Float
 longitude Float


 station   Station @relation(fields: [stationId], references: [id])
 stationId String


 pressure    Float
 temperature Float
 humidity    Float
 co2         Float
 dust        Float
 wind        Float
 uv          Float
 ir          Float

 accelZ      Float
 angVelX     Float
 angVelY     Float
 angVelZ     Float


 timeTaken DateTime
}
</code></pre>
<p>We kept this structure consistent between internal data structures, and the format we receive data through the API. We originally included the position in the Station table, but later moved it to the time series data table to account for the stations being uprooted or relocated. </p>
<p>In our GET API route, we utilized Prisma’s powerful filtering features to limit and select specific items. We were able to take advantage of this because of our database structure choices. We filter by time, in ascending order, to select the latest entries, which have the largest time stamps. We further filter by only selecting the last 5 hours. Furthermore, we take the data, which contains 60 datapoints per second, and condense it down to 1 datapoint per minute using averages. </p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const data = await prisma.station.findMany({
  include: {
  weatherData: {
   orderBy: {
    timeTaken: &quot;asc&quot;
   },
   where: {
    timeTaken: {
     gte: new Date(new Date().getMilliseconds() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 5) 
    }
   }
  },
 }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Our POST API route is used to collect data from the station. It is designed to receive a request from our master node and contains the data for each of the pods. It includes very basic key bearer authentication that simplifies and protects our application. We chose the data structure for the payload in order to be consistent with internal data structures and the database structure, and it was easily implemented on the embedded system on our physical device. We also include data points for our simulated stations that slightly modify the actual data to simulate varying weather conditions in a region. </p>
<p>Our UI design choices were based on speed and efficiency. This is why we decided to go with Typescript, as its strongly typed nature allows us to identify type errors before we run code quickly. We also decided to use Tailwindcss in order to quickly style our components. Finally, Next.js allows us to quickly test, build, and deploy. </p>
<p>The web interface consists of an interactive map and a navigation bar containing information from the sensors. Different tabs display relevant charts and statistics for corresponding environmental measurements, including Earthquake detection (by calculating an aggregated average of accelerometer values),  soil moisture percentage, average/max/min temperature and humidity, light wavelengths, and geographic position. </p>
<p>Using the library ChartJS alongside html canvas, we can create an interactive UI to showcase the data and allow users to vizualize ARES pods. ChartJS allowed us to quickly chart and format our data, and helped us greatly save time and create an appealing front end. Furthermore, html canvas allowed us to place the pods on the map in their exact positions based on their collected latitude and longitude. </p>
<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>
<p>The backend Arduino code integrates seamlessly with the frontend by using JSON as a standardized data format to transmit sensor information. Within the code, sensor readings from multiple devices—such as temperature, humidity, UV index, IR levels, soil moisture, and motion data from the MPU6050—are structured into a JSON document using the ArduinoJson library. This JSON payload encapsulates the sensor data along with metadata like timestamps and station identifiers, making it easy to manage and extend. Once the payload is constructed, it is serialized into a string and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote API endpoint. This API, which is typically part of a backend service connected to the frontend, receives the JSON data and processes it accordingly. A sample JSON string which is transmitted will look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;time&quot;:22651,&quot;stations&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;STATION_1&quot;,&quot;latitude&quot;:0.1,&quot;longitude&quot;:0.1,&quot;temperature&quot;:23,&quot;humidity&quot;:36,&quot;uv&quot;:0.02,&quot;ir&quot;:254,&quot;moisture&quot;:52,&quot;accel&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:1.019929886,&quot;y&quot;:-0.325611442,&quot;z&quot;:9.361329079},&quot;angVelocity&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:-0.041834611,&quot;y&quot;:0.022915773,&quot;z&quot;:-0.007993874}}]}
</code></pre>
<p>On the frontend, the received JSON data can be parsed and dynamically rendered using modern web development frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. The structured JSON makes it straightforward for the frontend to extract specific sensor readings and display them in an interactive dashboard—using charts, graphs, and real-time status updates. This approach allows for scalable integration where additional sensor data or stations can be added without disrupting the data flow. </p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>The integration of this system into an IoT-based monitoring framework has significant implications for real-time environmental sensing, data transmission, and decision-making. By systematically acquiring data from multiple sensors—including temperature, humidity, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, infrared (IR) levels, soil moisture, and motion tracking via the MPU6050—the system ensures a comprehensive representation of environmental conditions. The collected data is structured into a standardized JSON format, optimizing interoperability between hardware and software layers. Utilizing HTTP POST requests for data transmission enables continuous and automated logging, reducing the reliance on manual intervention and enhancing data accuracy. This approach facilitates real-time analytics and predictive modeling, supporting applications in smart agriculture, climate monitoring, and industrial process optimization.</p>
<p>From a systems engineering perspective, the use of JSON as a lightweight and structured data exchange format enhances system scalability and integration with web-based visualization tools. The modularity of the architecture allows for seamless expansion, enabling the incorporation of additional sensors without substantial modifications to the data processing pipeline. Furthermore, real-time data dissemination to frontend interfaces, such as interactive dashboards, enhances user engagement and decision support capabilities. This architecture enables advanced analytical techniques, including anomaly detection and machine learning-driven forecasting, by providing structured and time-synchronized datasets. The ability to efficiently collect, transmit, and visualize high-frequency sensor data has profound implications for scientific research, precision monitoring, and the development of autonomous systems.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>Future developments in this system can focus on enhancing data processing efficiency, expanding sensor integration, and improving real-time analytics capabilities. One key direction is the implementation of edge computing techniques to preprocess sensor data before transmission, reducing network congestion and minimizing latency in real-time applications. By incorporating onboard machine learning models, such as TinyML for anomaly detection or predictive analytics, the system could autonomously identify critical environmental changes and trigger automated responses. Additionally, improving the robustness of data transmission by implementing MQTT or WebSocket protocols could enable more efficient, low-latency communication compared to the current HTTP-based approach. Furthermore, integrating secure encryption mechanisms for JSON payloads and authentication protocols, such as OAuth 2.0, could enhance data integrity and privacy when transmitting sensitive environmental data to cloud-based platforms.</p>
