# Flashing Glasses

I built a pair of glasses that can light up and flash the LEDs based on how much sound is around them. The glasses came in a kit, of which the assembly instructions can be found [here](https://www.icstation.com/product_document/Download/GY20630_User_Manual.pdf).

I first soldered on the 1k, 10k, and 2M ohm resistors, respectively.

I then soldered on the microphone and started on the LEDs.

Here is what the glasses looked like after all the LEDs had been put in place:

Next, I installed the 0.1uF 104 capacitor and LED driver.

Then, I soldered on the transistor, 10uF electrolytic capacitors, and potentiometer. After adding the switch and battery holders, the board is complete.

After putting the board into the plastic frame, this is what the completed glasses look like:
