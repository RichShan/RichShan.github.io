# Cardboard Storage Box

Today, I cut and assembled a cardboard box to use for storage in the future. 

First, I downloaded the provided CDR file out of Google Drive.

<p style="text-align: center;">I then ran the file through the laser cutter and took out the cardboard.

This is the box after the cut. I folded in all the parts of the box to ensure that they assembled nicely.
